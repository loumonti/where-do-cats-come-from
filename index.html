  <p> This is the <b>Proailurus</b> <i>(meaning "before the cat" in greek lol)</i></p>
  <p>It is considered the first cat due to its characteristic matching the ones of modern day kitties.  They lived <b>25 million years ago</b> approximately during the <b>Oligocene epoch</b>, and they are the oldest recorded ancestor of the cats, being one of the first in the line of feline evolution.</p>
  <p>Also, they were <b>solitary cars</b>, taking the world by themselves. But no worries, they liked it, they had superpowers of <b>stealth and silence</b> to get their fav foods. <i>(Little batmans, ykwim?)</i></p>

  <h2>Who came next?</h2>
  <p>How did we go from a singular kitty to all types of kitties, from small hairballs to gimenosaurus tiggers?</p>
  <p>Quick summary of all modern-day lineages of cars from oldest to most recent babies!</p>

  <h3>Panthera lineage:</h3>
  <p>Here we've got most big cars such as Snow Leopards, Tigers, Jaguars, Lions, Leopards and their variants.</p>

  <h3>Bay Cat lineage:</h3>
  <p>These small kitties can only be found in the forests of Southest Asia and are the Marbled Cat, the Borneo Bay cat and the Asiatic Golden Cat.</p>

  <h3>Caracal Lineage:</h3>
  <p>Middle-sized cars found in Africa. They include the Serval, the African Golden Cat and the Caracal.</p>

  <h3>Leopardus Lineage:</h3>
  <p>13 small spotted cats found in Central and South America. These are mostly known as the Ocelot lineage. Some of them include the Ocelot <i>(ofc)</i>, Pampas cat, Geoffroy's cat, Margay, Andean cat and more.</p>

  <h3>Lynx Lineage:</h3>
  <p>Here we have the short tailed, fluffy with pointed ears cars. They are used to brrbrr cold places in the north. They include the Canada Lynx, Bobcat, Eurasian Lynx and Iberian Lynx. <i>(Ik they are all called lynx ,but they are different, trust)</i></p>

  <h3>Puma Lineage:</h3>
  <p>These include a variety of cars, such as the cheetah, the Jaguanundi and the Puma. <i>(no crap sherlock)</i></p>

  <h3>Leopard Cat Lineage:</h3>
  <p><i>("What?! Leopards?! Again?!", nuh uh they tiny kitties) They are found in Asia and are the Fishing cat, Mainland Leopard Cat, Sunda Leopard Cat, sweet Palla's cat, Flat-headed cat, and Rusty-spotted cat.</i></p>

  <h3>Felis Lineage:</h3>
  <p>These are the most recent and most similar to our house kitties. They are found all over the world. They are the Jungle cat, African-Asiatic cat, Chinese Mountain cat, European Wildcat, Sand cat, Black-footed cat. <i>(Basically we came, saw those cats and said "Oh yk, we could give them cuddles and food if they eat our rats!" And they became our sillies.)</i></p>
